# Wordcount

In this assignment you will use your knowledge of Python basic strings, arithmetic, file reading, and dictionaries to create a command line utility to count the words in the text files in the `books` directory &mdash; ([small.txt](./books/small.txt) and [alice.txt](./books/alice.txt)).

Complete the command-line python program named `wordcount.py` so that it will count the number of words in a text file using optional flags named `--count` and `--topcount`.

## Example
```console
$ python wordcount.py --count books/alice.txt
"'tis : 1
"--said : 1
"come : 2
"coming : 1
"edwin : 1
"french, : 1
"he's : 1
"how : 2
"i : 8
"i'll : 2
"it" : 2
"keep : 1
"let : 1
"much : 1
"poison" : 1
"purpose"?' : 1
```

```console
$ python wordcount.py --topcount books/alice.txt
Top 20 most frequent words in books/alice.txt
the : 1605
and : 766
to : 706
a : 614
she : 518
of : 493
said : 421
it : 362
in : 352
was : 333
you : 265
i : 261
as : 249
that : 222
alice : 221
her : 208
at : 206
had : 176
with : 169
all : 155
```

## Part A
For the `--count` flag, implement a `print_words()` function that counts how often each word appears in the text and prints:

    word1 : count1
    word2 : count2
    ...
  
Print the above list in order, sorted alphabetically by word (Python will sort punctuation to come before letters, which is fine &mdash; do not strip out punctuation). Store all the words as lowercase (i.e., 'The' and 'the' count as the same word).

## Part B
For the `--topcount` flag, implement a `print_top()` function similar to `print_words()`, but which prints just the top 20 most common words sorted so the **most common** word is first, then the next most common, and so on.


# Debugging
Use your VS Code IDE to set up a debug session and single-step your `wordcount.py` &mdash; Create two launch.json debug configurations: One with optional `--count` argument and one with `--topcount` argument.
